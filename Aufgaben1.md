1. Add 2 numbers together! (just type console.log(23 + 97) into your html file)
    Add a sequence of 6 different numbers together.
    Print the solution to the following equation: (4 + 6 + 9) / 77

    Answer should be approximately 0.24675

    Let’s use variables!

    Type the following at the top of the script tag: let a = 10
    In the console console.log(a) should print 10
    Try the following: 9 * a
    and this: let b = 7 * a (returns undefined *) and then console.log(b)

    You should be getting the hang of this by now… try this sequence:

    Declare a constant variable max with the value 57
    Set another variable actual to max - 13
    Set another variable percentage to actual / max
    If you type percentage in the console and press enter you should see a value like 0.7719
